# OctoPad

OctoPad uses [Jekyll] and a Javascript implementation of the [GitHub API] to create a full blogging engine that requires no git knowledge on the users part.

## A Warning

This application is stil under heavy development and this repo only exists so that I have a repo to test against. (Has to be a GH Repo not just a git repo)

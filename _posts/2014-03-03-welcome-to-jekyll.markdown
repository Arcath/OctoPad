You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!



To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)  puts "Hi, #{name}"

end


print_hi('Tom')



#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].



This edit was made using OctoPad. I then tried to tidy up the spacing in OctoPad, maybe an issue if you mix editors?
